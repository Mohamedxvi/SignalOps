SignalOps

SignalOps is an advanced, professional signal detection, analysis, and manipulation tool designed to work across a wide range of frequencies. This project is aimed at anyone interested in working with wireless signals, from car keys and RFID systems to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other common communication technologies. SignalOps leverages powerful signal-processing techniques to detect, analyze, and even simulate signals within the frequency spectrum.

Features

Comprehensive Signal Detection:
Detect signals across a broad frequency range (from MHz to GHz) used by various devices such as car keys, RFID tags, Bluetooth devices, Wi-Fi networks, and more.

Signal Analysis:
Visualize signal strength and frequency with real-time analysis using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to examine detected signals for patterns, power, and frequency content.

Signal Jamming (Simulation):
The tool allows users to simulate jamming of detected frequencies. (Note: Actual signal jamming is illegal in many regions. This feature is for educational and research purposes only.)

Signal Saving and Replay:
Users can save detected signals for later use, replay them, or simulate their transmission to test devices or networks.

Frequency Classification:
Automatically classify the detected signals based on known frequency bands and their usage (e.g., RFID, car key fobs, AM/FM radio, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, etc.).

Signal Management:
Save, replay, and delete detected signals for ongoing analysis. The tool provides a simple menu for easy management of saved signals.


Technologies Used

Python
The core programming language for building the application.

RTL-SDR (Software Defined Radio)
A low-cost USB device that allows software to process radio signals. This is used for frequency scanning and signal detection.

NumPy & SciPy
Libraries used for numerical computing and signal processing, including FFT for frequency analysis.

Pickle (Python Library)
Used for saving and loading detected signal data.


Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

RTL-SDR USB device

Required Python libraries:

rtlsdr

numpy

scipy

pickle



Steps

1. Install Python 3.x (if not already installed).


2. Install the necessary Python libraries:

pip install rtlsdr numpy scipy


3. Set up the RTL-SDR USB device and connect it to your machine.


4. Clone or download this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Mohamedxvi/SignalOps/signalops.git


5. Run the main program:

python signalops.py



Usage

1. Start the Application:
Launch the program, and it will display a list of frequency categories to scan for.


2. Scan and Detect Signals:
Select the signal type (e.g., Car, RFID, Wi-Fi, etc.), and the program will scan for nearby signals in that category.


3. Analyze and Save Signals:
Detected signals will be shown with their frequency and power. You can save them for later use, replay them, or delete them as needed.


4. Signal Management:
Manage saved signals using the provided menu to replay or remove them.
